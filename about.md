## Hello there! 

I have strong interest in web and mobile design. I started to expose myself to Adobe Illustrator and created illustrations based on tutorials. I also create mockup for mobile application. Currently, I am taking design courses from <a href="http://udemy.com" title="Udemy" target="_blank">udemy</a>. During my free time I read blogs such as <a title="sidebar" href="http://sidebar.io" target="_blank">sidebar.io</a>, <a title="Designer's News" href="http://news.layervault.com/stories" target="_blank">Designer News</a> and browse <a title="Dribbble" href="http://dribbble.com" target="_blank">dribbble</a>.

I realised that a practical and useful website is not just about the aesthetic aspects but also consists of many factors such as good user experience, being functional, work well in various browsers, etc. Thus, I understand that front-end knowledge is crucial.

Follow my blog if you would like to learn more about front-end programming or programming in general.
